# A Short Poem

*Lines of code dance on the screen,*
*Like stars in a digital dream.*
*Each function a verse, each bug a rhyme,*
*Creating worlds one commit at a time.*

*From simple scripts to complex art,*
*Every project has a beating heart.*
*In the quiet glow of midnight screens,*
*We build tomorrow's digital dreams.*
